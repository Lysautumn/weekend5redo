# Giphy Weekend Assignment

This assignment for Prime Digital Academy was to create a full stack web application. This application allows the user to look at random gifs from Giphy, search for gifs, and save gifs. It also allows the user to view saved gifs.

## To use:

In order to view this app, the user must run npm install in their terminal to install all the dependencies for the app. The user then must run npm start in the terminal to start the server. In the browser, go to localhost:3000 to view the app.

## TO DO:

This app is still in progress. There are some errors that need to be taken care of. I would also like to spend some time in the future working on the styling of the page.
